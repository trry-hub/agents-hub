# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-05-09

### Phase 7: Full Product Acceptance Sweep
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Accepted the user request to test every plugin function from top to bottom and fix issues without stopping at analysis.
  - Re-read `planning-with-files` and `systematic-debugging` workflows.
  - Re-read `task_plan.md`, `package.json`, `scripts/preview-webview.mjs`, and extension activation code.
  - Added Phase 7 to `task_plan.md` for full acceptance.
  - Detected local providers: Claude Code exists at `/Users/t/.local/bin/claude` but is not on the raw shell PATH; Gemini, Codex, and OpenCode are on PATH; Goose and Aider are not installed.
  - Tried Computer Use against Visual Studio Code again; macOS still returned Apple event error `-1743`.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 1: Requirements, Baseline, And Recovery
- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-05-09 Asia/Shanghai
- Actions taken:
  - Invoked the requested `planning-with-files` workflow.
  - Tried the documented session catchup script and found this installation does not include `scripts/session-catchup.py`.
  - Inspected the skill templates and current git status.
  - Confirmed the worktree already contains many staged product changes; this pass must not revert them.
  - Created project-root planning files.
  - Inspected `.vscode/launch.json`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, `package.json`, and `scripts/preview-webview.mjs`.
  - Confirmed the official debug route is Extension Host + `npm: watch`, with a preview route for visual iteration.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md` (created)
  - `findings.md` (created)
  - `progress.md` (created)

### Phase 2: Real Debug Use And Gap Capture
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Starting debug/preview usage.
  - Built the extension successfully with `npm run build`.
  - Generated `/tmp/agents-hub-preview/agents-hub-preview.html`.
  - Computer Use could not access VS Code because macOS returned Apple event error `-1743`.
  - Started a local preview server on port 51437 after sandbox denied binding without escalation.
  - Opened the preview in Playwright at 430x860 and captured initial screenshot/snapshot.
  - Switched preview to OpenCode and inspected model, agent, context, and multi-agent picker popovers.
  - Found OpenCode send button was transparent on white background.
  - Ran official OpenCode CLI discovery and a minimal real `run --format json --thinking` prompt.
- Files created/modified:
  - `agents-hub-preview-initial.png` (preview artifact)
  - `agents-hub-preview-initial.yml` (preview artifact)
  - `findings.md` (updated)
  - `progress.md` (updated)

### Phase 3: Product Decisions And Design Cleanup
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Decided to filter internal OpenCode primary agents from main agent selection.
  - Decided to treat OpenCode `/models` and `/agents` as local UI commands.
  - Decided send button visibility is a release-blocking usability issue.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 4: Implementation
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Filtered OpenCode `summary`, `title`, and `compaction` primary agents in parser paths.
  - Added fallback CSS vars for the OpenCode send button.
  - Added OpenCode `/models` and `/agents` local slash commands.
  - Prevented send-button click propagation from closing menus opened by slash commands.
  - Removed OpenCode's abstract `Default` model option when concrete discovered models are available.
  - Renamed OpenCode fallback model and agent mode from `Default` to `Configured/当前配置`.
  - Ensured discovered OpenCode model lists remove both legacy `default` and fallback `configured` entries.
  - Changed composer popovers from static absolute alignment to viewport-aware fixed positioning.
  - Expanded the preview OpenCode Agent list to include long custom agents and disabled subagents for clipping regression checks.
  - Removed the multi-agent participant picker, `/compare` slash command, recommendation fan-out, and task grouping.
  - Changed send behavior so each send targets only the currently active provider and its selected agent mode.
  - Changed the extension default provider to OpenCode across manifest config, sidebar fallback logic, and preview fixtures.
  - Disabled the visible task-board strip while single-agent flows are being stabilized, keeping task state internal only.
  - Changed OpenCode agent discovery and preview fixtures so the Agent menu only shows switchable primary agents, matching the official OpenCode mental model.
  - Fixed OpenCode freeform context injection so workspace-only context is still sent instead of falling back to a raw prompt.
  - Made the context chip visible for workspace-only context so users can see when `@工作区` is attached.
  - Added recent thread conversation history to provider requests so follow-up questions can reference prior chat content.
  - Polished the OpenCode layout: softened the default composer border, made the accent border appear only on focus, reduced disabled send-button weight, quieted compact model/agent/context controls, tightened transcript spacing, and added bottom breathing room.
  - Fixed Claude and Gemini headless invocation so prompts are passed as CLI arguments instead of writing to a persistent stdin session.
  - Added one-shot stdin EOF handling for headless stdin providers and restricted stdin session reuse to profiles that explicitly opt into `keepStdinOpen`.
  - Added a 45-second no-output notice for provider processes that are still running but have produced no stdout/stderr, so the sidebar does not silently sit on Thinking forever.
  - Switched Claude Code to `--output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages` and added `text_delta` parsing so Claude output can render incrementally instead of arriving as one completed block.
  - Suppressed Claude Code final assistant/result JSON messages in the formatter to prevent duplicate rendering after partial streaming.
  - Updated tests for parser, CSS, and slash command behavior.
- Files created/modified:
  - `src/opencodeAgents.ts`
  - `media/main.css`
  - `media/main.js`
  - `media/i18n.js`
  - `scripts/preview-webview.mjs`
  - `src/cliManager.ts`
  - `tests/promptBuilder.test.mjs`

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-05-09 | Missing `session-catchup.py` under `/Users/t/.agents/skills/planning-with-files/scripts/` | 1 | Inspected available templates and initialized planning files manually. |
| 2026-05-09 | Computer Use `list_apps`/`get_app_state` returned Apple event error `-1743` | 1 | Fell back to Playwright preview and shell-driven Extension Host inspection. |
| 2026-05-09 | Sandbox denied `python3 -m http.server 51437` with `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted` | 1 | Re-ran with approved escalation for the temporary local preview server. |
| 2026-05-09 | Direct `opencode agent list/models` hit `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)` DB lock | 1 | Retried with isolated `OPENCODE_DB` and escalation for SQLite/WAL access. |
| 2026-05-09 | OpenCode send button had transparent background in preview | 1 | Added fallback theme variables in provider-specific CSS. |
| 2026-05-09 | `/models` opened then immediately closed | 1 | Stopped send-button click propagation so document outside-click handler does not close the newly opened menu. |
| 2026-05-09 | OpenCode model menu showed confusing `Default` option despite concrete models | 1 | Drop `default` from OpenCode model options when discovery returns real models. |
| 2026-05-09 | OpenCode fallback model/agent labels still used confusing `Default` semantics | 1 | Changed OpenCode fallback to `Configured/当前配置` and added regression assertions. |
| 2026-05-09 | Long OpenCode Agent popover was clipped or pressed against the sidebar edge | 1 | Switched composer popovers to fixed viewport-aware positioning and clamped their bounding box to the webview viewport. |
| 2026-05-09 | Multi-agent compare/fan-out made the product harder to stabilize | 1 | Removed participant selection and compare planning so each provider can be validated as a normal single agent first. |
| 2026-05-09 | OpenCode felt like it had no context when no editor was active | 1 | Root cause was OpenCode freeform only injecting context for file/selection/diagnostics; fixed workspace-only context injection and chip visibility. |
| 2026-05-09 | Follow-up questions felt like they had no memory of prior chat | 1 | Root cause was webview not sending stored thread messages to the provider request; added bounded recent conversation history to prompts. |
| 2026-05-09 | Claude and similar CLIs could stay on Thinking for minutes | 1 | Root cause was treating headless prompt modes as persistent stdin sessions; Claude/Gemini now receive prompt arguments, one-shot stdin closes with EOF, and silent providers show a no-output notice. |
| 2026-05-09 | Claude Code waited then rendered the whole answer at once | 1 | Root cause was using default text output; Claude now runs with `stream-json`, `--verbose`, and `--include-partial-messages`, and the formatter streams `text_delta` chunks. |
| 2026-05-09 | OpenCode smoke delayed or timed out during PostHog flush | 1 | Disabled `oh-my-openagent` PostHog telemetry for extension-managed OpenCode processes and QA smoke. |
| 2026-05-09 | Codex smoke stalled through the default model path | 1 | Switched Codex default model to explicit `gpt-5.4`, removed the visible model `Default`, and made prompt runs ephemeral. |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 7 complete |
